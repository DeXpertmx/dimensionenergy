Task: Deploy Dimension Energy stack from tar file and fix invoice modal data population bug

Work Log:
- Extracted dimensionenergy.tar from /home/z/my-project/upload/
- Analyzed full project structure: 13 dimension-energy components, 4 API routes, Prisma schema with Lead/ContactMessage models
- Copied all dimension-energy components to /src/components/dimension-energy/
- Copied store/navigation.ts with Zustand navigation + cookie state management
- Updated globals.css with Dimension Energy custom color scheme (de-blue, de-success, etc.) and animations
- Updated layout.tsx with Spanish locale and Dimension Energy metadata
- Wrote page.tsx with full SPA routing, invoice extraction flow, and contact form integration
- Updated Prisma schema with Lead and ContactMessage models, pushed to SQLite
- Created API routes: extract-invoice (VLM), submit-lead (Prisma + Volkern CRM), submit-contact (Prisma + Volkern CRM)
- **Fixed critical bug**: InvoiceModal formData was initialized with null extractedData (processing state) and never updated when API returned real data. Refactored to use `useMemo` + `localEdits` pattern instead of stale `useState` + `useEffect(setState)` approach, also fixing React lint errors.

Stage Summary:
- Full Dimension Energy website deployed: landing page, FAQ, contact, legal pages, RGPD banner
- Invoice VLM extraction working with proper data population in verification form
- Prisma models for Lead and ContactMessage with local SQLite storage
- Volkern CRM integration (falls back to local-only when API key not configured)
- Lint passes cleanly with zero errors
